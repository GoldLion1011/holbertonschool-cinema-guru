Welcome! This is a web application built using React JS and hooks that allows you to manage and keep track of your favorite movies, as well as set up a watch later list. This README will guide you through the project setup, usage, and important information.

## Project Overview

As a beginning web development student, I am working on this project to achieve the following learning objectives:

Please ensure that you follow these guidelines:
